To support model development, we have curated the [SongEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ASLP-lab/SongEval) datasetâ€”an open-source benchmark containing **2,399 full-length songs** (approx. **140.3 hours** of generated song) from a variety of genres and languages. These songs have been annotated across five aesthetic dimensions:
- **Overall Coherence**
- **Memorability**
- **Naturalness of Vocal Breathing and Phrasing**
- **Clarity of Song Structure**
- **Overall Musicality**

The dataset covers a wide range of genres including **Pop, Rock, Jazz, Hip-hop, Classical**, and more. It includes songs in both **English** and **Mandarin Chinese**, making it a diverse resource for training models. For more details concerning the dataset, we refer to [our dataset paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10793).
