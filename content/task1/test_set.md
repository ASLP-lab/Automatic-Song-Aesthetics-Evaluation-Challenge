## Track 1: Overall Musicality Score Prediction

Two types of test sets are provided for Track 1:

**Set 1**: Contains songs generated by the same generative models used in the training set.

**Set 2 (Challenge Set)**: Includes songs generated by 10 different open-source generative models, offering a more diverse and challenging evaluation scenario. This set aims to assess each model’s generalization ability to unseen generation systems.
